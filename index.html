      <p>
        Few books have the power to transport you back to childhood. For me, any book with Sherlock Holmes in it,
        does the trick. I remember borrowing books from friendsand reading them huddled in a corner of my bed. It
        was a perfect accompaniment to wintry nights. It still is.

      <h2>About Book</h2>
      <p>
        This book contain <em>five</em>, totally new, <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> adventures, which took place after Holmes and Whatson
        believe they have gone into retirement. Of course, you and I know, such a notion is irrealizable for either of them.
        Indeed, some of their most remarkable, and dangerous, adventure await them.<br>
        While each story is a separate adventure, the five tales within this collection follow one another chronologically.
        Some characters move from one story to the next as well. Therefore it is suggested that you read each of the stroies
        in the order they appear in the book.<br>
        If you are not already a Sherlock Holmes fan, it is hoped that these stories will encourage you to in the origional
        canon, as well as the many excellent stories and the books that are keeping the spirit of Holmes and Whatson alive
         in the world.
